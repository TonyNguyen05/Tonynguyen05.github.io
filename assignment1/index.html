The project's name is obviously behind the objects but readable and easy to perform to the user at the first glance. The pastel color palette also puts a stress on the concept of the project while it creates an environment of a playground with games, sports and trees around. The whole picture fully express the developer team vibes of a dynamic, friendly and colorful environment. Additionally, the menu section can be accessed in 3 manners by the 3D objects, a bar at the right bottom and another on the right top. This design approach provides the users different paths of function, which avoid monotonous layout</div>

               <h1 class="questions">What part of the experience did you spend the most time engaging with?</h1>
               <div>I spent the most time on the mini games on the Omada page playing emulated soccer and basketball game. The games are simple and easy to play but the interactions are smooth and the figures are cartoonated, which really appeals to me. The most satisfying part is when I score a point, there will be an emission of coins which stimulate the users with the feeling of winning. Besides, the games contain competitive elements which are the point records of players, so that users are eager to break the record and spend more time in the website. Accordingly, the developer solution for keeping the users stay in the website is possibly considered successful humbly due to my slight addiction to the mini game</div>
            </div>

            <div class="number4">
                <h1 class="question46">What was the most common action in your two minute interaction with the experience?</h1>
                <div>It is evident that one of the most repeated actions of computer users is moving the mouse curser around. Apart from clicking and choosing, this action is also perfomed when people start thinking or relieving stress as a part of their habit. So, most of the time interacting with the website, moving the mouse curser around is one of the most frequent actions I have as all the 3D objects are programmed to react back in the way of moving backwards to the curser. This effect is obviously pre-calculated since the action of moving the curser is the most common action when people use the computer. The developer team has cleverly turn a boring action into a interactive and playful one</div>
            </div>

            <div class="number5">
                <h1 class="questions">What is your impression of the intended primary goal of the interactive experience?</h1>
                <div>I am deeply impressed by the combination of the applications concepts and the interactive figures. The 3D models are created to demonstrate the content and meaning of each page and interact directly with the user actions. Therefore, it is visible that the pimary goal of the project is to introduce the company's projects on apps in which lifestyle and sports are the themes. By this, the developer attach each sort of 3D elements on each page before the introduction of the app for a preview. On the other hands, the delivery of the project also aims to approach the teenagers or youngster owing to the youthful and dynamic colors and concept while having a healthy lifestyle is alert and prior to be cope with among the young in the modern age. </div>
            </div>

              <div class="number6">
                <h1 class="question46">How does the interactive experience communicate this primary goal?</h1>
                <div>In order not to foolow the old path of getting the customers informed with the application information at the beginning with illustrative elements attached on a side, there are four seperated home pages for each of the app where people can experience the interactive 3D models that is not only a distinguish preview for the app but also a way to cheer up the users mood before reading a long paragraph of text for getting to khow and undersatnd their project. To be specific, before getting in exploring the app, user can play around with the mouse curser by clicking the objects and see the reactions. This helps the users to have the initial figuration of the app without reading any introduction and they can enjoy some sort of entertainment as well</div>

                <h1 class="questions">What is your impression of how the experience should be interacted with over time? (For how long and how many different times)</h1>
                <div>The most impressive part of the project is the interactive effect when moving the curser around. As i mentioned before, moving the curser is indeed my most common action i have during the time using the computer. Things start to be interesting when there is an effect programmed to this action, which made my experience more stimulating than ever even to the smallest part. I was absorbed in playing around with that for half an hour and see the differences between pages. For instance, the objects will spread out and then move slightly when the curser move towards. In addition, the menu bars will lean towards the curser on any sides. These can be regarded as simple and small details but straight-forwardly focus on every action including the most common ones of the users leading to an environments of interactive things without a single dead space</div>

                <h1 class="questions">How does the interactive experience communicate how it should be interacted with over time?</h1>
                <div>It is a certain that the developer has brought a full view of a system of applications where the active life style is the theme and the team wants to convey this message to the youngsters. All the functions and sections in the website require users to have many actions and interact with it. This can be implied that the developer has introduce to the applicants the vibe and characteristics that needed to be a member of the company according to the "9 talents". The team tended to create 3D objects with slow but smooth movements, which raises users’ curiosity and spent their time playing around first before getting into the information, which is not a quick approach and the users have to achieve an overview by playing around first. However, the transition between the pages may be frustrating to a number of people but it, in some ways, lengthen the amount of time users experience the website</div>

                <h1 class="questions">What other media forms (digital or otherwise) does the experience reference?</h1>
                <div>Beside the 2 lifestyle and fitness app (Spark and Coach+) there is also another game app for sport betting but generally legal without using real money, where users can interact and compete with each other. The idea came up based on the initial goal that the company want to achieve that the healthy lifestyle is important among the young generation. While using Coach+ and Spark can contribute to a doing exercise habit to improve physical health, Omada The new form of media contributes to the diversity of the company developments in applications which promote their activities and vary the range of the customers, which in this case are the sportaholic</div>
